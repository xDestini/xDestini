# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mario Alemán!

I'm a passionate **software developer** with 3+ years of experience building mobile and web applications. I love turning ideas into real products that people can use, whether it's in the app store, on the web, or as a fun experiment!

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Languages:** JavaScript • TypeScript
- **Mobile:** React Native (for beautiful, performant apps on iOS & Android)
- **Web:** Next.js, Vite (for lightning-fast, modern web experiences)
- **Experimenter:** Sometimes I tinker with Python for creative side-projects (like extracting the predominant color from images!)

## 🛠️ Featured Projects (Public)

- 🎨 [Image Palette](https://github.com/IPN-Mario-Aleman/image-palette): Python experiment to get the predominant color of an image.
- 📊 [Finance App](https://github.com/IPN-Mario-Aleman/finance-app): Exploring financial tools and utilities.
- 📚 [JavaScript Vanilla Study](https://github.com/IPN-Mario-Aleman/javascript-vanilla-study): Deep dives and refreshers on core JS concepts.

> Most of my favorite work lives in private repos, or is shipped directly to the app/play stores. If you want to see more, just ask!

## 🎮 When Not Coding...

I’m probably playing video games, or diving into the latest tech releases to stay on the bleeding edge. I believe in continuous learning and love discovering new frameworks, tools, and libraries.
